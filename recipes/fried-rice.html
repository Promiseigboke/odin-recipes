            <img src="images/fried-rice-and-chicken2.jpg" alt="fried-rice" width="400">
            <p>Nigerian Fried Rice is a very delicious recipe. it is also very simple to make. This Fried rice is entirely different from the Aian chicken Type of Fried Rice. This is because the main taste in the latter comes from the soy sauce while the main taste in the former comes from Seasoning cubes, Curry powder, Thyme, and of course of the availability of sufficient vegetables like Green beans, Carrots, Peas, sweet corn, and Onions.</p>
            <p>This is a very simple recipe, but the impact it makes is quite remarkable!</p>
